# Analyze-Stock-Data-using-R-and-Quantmod-Package


Data Analytics:  Analyze Stock Data using the R Quantmod Package is divided into following tasks:

Task 1: We will first download stock data using quantmod and the Yahoo Finance API.  We will then get practice with the syntax of quantmod by sub-setting the stock data.

Task 2: We will dive deeper into Data Frames and Time Series Objects and learn the difference between them.

Task 3: We will pull down adjusted daily return stock data using Microsoft's stock, then calculate the daily returns as well.

Task 4: Data from two stock companies will be pulled for comparison.  Starbucks and Microsoft will be the two companies used.

Task 5: We will calculate the Sharp Ratio on multiple stocks to see which stock is truly the riskier asset or the stock with the best risk return profile.
